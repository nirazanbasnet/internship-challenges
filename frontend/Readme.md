## Frontend the design

### What you need to do

* If you haven't already done so, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “webo-frontend-challenge” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship@webo.digital to that particular private repo
* Submit your application

#### Problem

1. Open the Frontend Challenge UI using this [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/KdMCkobmwma5vmWQGVAs6I/Intern-Design-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1).
2. Once open, you'll  be able to see following screen: 
 - Home
5. Your assignment is to turn the "Home" screen into an interactive web page using HTML/ CSS (if possible JS). 
5. Upload the html/css/js file into your repo

We'll be looking into following aspects of your assignment and using them as judging criteria:
- How well the webpage you've made matches with the design file in Figma
- The HTML/ CSS structure 
- Use of proper tags
- Naming convention of class names
- Use of shorthand properties
- Folder structure
- Responsiveness
- CSS preprocessors (plus point)
- CSS/ JS animations (plus point)
